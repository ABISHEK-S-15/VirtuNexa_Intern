📘 Fibonacci Series Generator – Java Swing Application
🔰 Project Overview
This is a Java Swing-based GUI application that generates and displays the Fibonacci series based on user input. The user can choose between:

Generating Fibonacci numbers up to a specified number, or

Generating a specific number of terms in the series.

🧩 Features
GUI-based input using Java Swing.

Option to choose between:

Fibonacci up to a number

Fibonacci by number of terms

Input validation with proper error messaging.

Scrollable output display using a JTextArea.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Component	Description
Java	Core logic and application code
Swing	GUI (Graphical User Interface)
🖥️ UI Components
JTextField – for user to input the number.

JRadioButton – to select between the two modes:

"Up to Number"

"By Number of Terms"

JButton – to trigger the Fibonacci generation.

JTextArea – displays the result.

JOptionPane – shows error messages if invalid input is entered.

🔎 How It Works
User Workflow:
Launch the application.

Enter a number in the input field.

Select one of the two options:

"Up to Number": Generates Fibonacci numbers ≤ input value.

"By Number of Terms": Generates the first N terms of the Fibonacci sequence.

Click on the “Generate” button or press Enter.

The result is shown in the scrollable text area.

Input Validation:
If a non-numeric value is entered, the app will show an error dialog using JOptionPane.

💡 Sample Usage
Input: 10, selected option: Up to Number
Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8

Input: 6, selected option: By Number of Terms
Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5
